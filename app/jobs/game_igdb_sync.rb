# Phase 14 §1 — Sidekiq job wrapping `Igdb::SyncGame#call`.
#
# Single argument `game_id`. On `Igdb::Client::RateLimited` /
# `ServerError` / network errors, raises so Sidekiq retries with
# exponential backoff (5 attempts). On `ValidationError` (game ID
# does not exist on IGDB) the local row is stamped with
# `last_sync_error` inside `Igdb::SyncGame` and the job swallows
# the raise so Sidekiq does NOT retry.
#
# Phase 14 §1 polish (2026-05-10) — `games.resyncing` mutex flag.
# The job flips `resyncing` true at start (skips when already in
# flight, so duplicate enqueues are no-ops) and back to false in
# an `ensure` block so a crash inside `SyncGame` still releases
# the lock.
#
# Phase 27 v2 spec 03 — two-layer lock + collection fan-out, mirroring
# `ReindexAllJob`'s pattern:
#
#   Layer 1 — DB mutex (`games.resyncing` Boolean). Set at start,
#             cleared in `ensure`. The controller consults the same
#             flag to short-circuit duplicate enqueues from the
#             breadcrumb [sync] click.
#   Layer 2 — Sidekiq uniqueness lock (`sidekiq_options lock:
#             :until_executed, on_conflict: :log`). Pito runs on
#             Sidekiq OSS without `sidekiq-unique-jobs`, so the
#             option is a NO-OP intent declaration today — the DB
#             flag (Layer 1) is the real safety net. If the gem is
#             ever added, the keys are already in place.
#
# UI feedback while a resync is in flight is handled entirely on
# `/games/:id` by the page-level `auto-refresh` controller (reloads
# every ~5 s while `@game.resyncing?` is true). The dedicated sync
# pane / banner and the `_sync_status` partial were removed —
# breadcrumb [sync] (muted-while-syncing per Wave C8) is the only
# control surface.
#
# Bundle cover-art fan-out (success path only) — every bundle the
# game belongs to gets its composite cover rebuilt via
# `Bundles::CompositeRebuildQueue#enqueue_for_game_resync`. The
# orchestrator alphabetizes and enqueues a sequential
# `BundleCoverBuild` chain so the UX (and the test suite) sees a
# predictable order. We call the orchestrator EXPLICITLY here even
# though the model's `after_save_commit
# :rebuild_bundle_composites_on_resync` hook also fires — the
# explicit call is the canonical spec-03 trigger (and the composer
# is idempotent on cache hit, so a duplicate enqueue is a no-op
# rebuild).
