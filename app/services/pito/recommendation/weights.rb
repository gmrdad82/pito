    # Seven signals blended into 0–100 (weights sum to 1.0):
    #   PP — player_perspective overlap. The strongest discriminator: a
    #        third-person action game and a side-view platformer are *not* the
    #        same kind of game even when their genre tags collide ("Adventure").
    #   E  — embedding / semantic similarity.
    #   G  — genre overlap.
    #   S  — score proximity.
    #   T  — theme overlap (Action / Sci-fi / Horror / Survival …).
    #   D  — developer overlap (counts for something).
    #   P  — publisher overlap (counts less).
    #
    # Weights tuned empirically against real IGDB data so that, vs Pragmata:
    # Dead Space ≈ 81, Mad Max ≈ 65, Ghosts 'n Goblins ≈ 28, Super Meat Boy ≈ 6.
    #
    # An explicit video→game link is definitive and bypasses the blend entirely
    # (LINK_SCORE). Anything below FLOOR is dropped (kept low so weak-but-real
    # matches like Super Meat Boy still surface).
