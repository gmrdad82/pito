# Local completion client (3.0.0) — the nlmapper sidecar's did-you-mean
# fallback for chat input the grammar-constrained mapper can't place.
#
# Single-purpose HTTP wrapper around the llama.cpp `nlmapper` sidecar's
# OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint (see the `nlmapper` service in
# docker-compose.yml / docker-compose.dev.yml) — POST `/v1/chat/completions`
# with a grammar-constrained multi-turn `messages` array, NOT the raw
# `/completion` endpoint. Switched 2026-07-15 (live-proof): raw-completion
# prompting fed Qwen3-0.6B a bare prompt string, bypassing the instruct
# model's own chat template — the model rambled inside the grammar's charset
# (a `rm games` hallucination came out of a plain list intent).
# `/v1/chat/completions` applies Qwen3's chat template AND lets the grammar
# additionally suppress its `<think>` preamble, which is what actually
# disciplines the output.
#
# Multi-turn, not a single system+user pair (also 2026-07-15, live-proof):
# Pito::Nl::Mapper originally packed its whole few-shot corpus as `owner:
# ...\ncommand: ...` lines inside ONE system-role string. A 0.6B instruct
# model imitates ALTERNATING chat turns far better than prose exemplars
# buried in a system block — the old shape left `greet` sitting as a
# constrained-decoding attractor regardless of the utterance. Mapper now
# hands this client one system turn (the instruction) plus a real
# user/assistant PAIR per exemplar, ending on the owner's own utterance as
# the final open user turn — see Pito::Nl::Mapper#chat_messages.
#
# `Pito::Embedding::Client` is the sibling that talks to a different
# sidecar (`embedder`) over `/v1/embeddings` — mirror its structure, not
# its route.
#
# Configuration: `ENV["PITO_NLMAPPER_URL"]` (http://nlmapper:8082 in the
# production stack, http://127.0.0.1:8092 for host-Puma dev). A blank or
# absent URL means "not configured".
#
# One contract, fully forgiving BY DESIGN (K2 data honesty): this client
# sits on the cold did-you-mean path, where nil simply means "the mapper
# has no opinion" and the unknown-input copy takes over — unconfigured
# URL, non-2xx, a malformed response, a network error, or a timeout all
# degrade to nil, never raise. Callers never need a rescue.
#
# Test behaviour: WebMock blocks non-localhost HTTP in test; specs stub
# the endpoint explicitly.

    class CompletionClient
      # Runs a grammar-constrained chat completion and returns the generated
      # text, or nil on ANY failure. `messages` is the full OpenAI-shaped
      # turn array (`[{ role:, content: }, ...]`) the caller composed — this
      # client is deliberately low-level and opinion-free about HOW that
      # array is built (single system+user pair, multi-turn few-shot, or
      # anything else); see Pito::Nl::Mapper for the one caller that exists
      # today. `grammar` is a GBNF string (see Pito::Nl::GbnfBuilder);
      # `max_tokens` bounds `n_predict` (llama.cpp's own extension param,
      # still honored on the `/v1/chat/completions` route alongside
      # `messages`). `repeat_penalty` rides straight through to llama.cpp's
      # own sampling param (default 1.0, i.e. off — matching llama.cpp's own
      # default so every OTHER caller sees no behavior change). Live-proof,
      # 2026-07-15: Pito::Nl::Mapper's unbounded (1.0) sampling was observed
      # padding digit runs — a two-token answer like "link 14 3" kept
      # decoding past the valid command instead of stopping — so Mapper now
      # calls with 1.1 to discourage the decoder from repeating itself.
      #
      # K2 distinction (mirrors Pito::Embedding::Client's forgiving path):
      # this method never raises and never calls Appsignal.report_error.
      # Every failure here — unconfigured URL, non-2xx, malformed JSON, a
      # network error — degrades to nil BY DESIGN (the mapper's own
      # did-you-mean copy takes over), so it is not an incident; the warn
      # log (with the response code on non-2xx, for operator visibility)
      # is the right amount of noise. Reporting cold-path nils to AppSignal
      # would page/alert on expected behavior every time the mapper simply
      # has no opinion.
