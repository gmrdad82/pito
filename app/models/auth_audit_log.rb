# Phase 25 — 01c (LD-13). Auth audit log row.
#
# Every privileged auth action (approve / block / unblock / purge /
# TOTP enroll / TOTP disable / backup-code regenerate) writes one row
# via `Auth::AuditLogger`. The row is the canonical "who did what,
# from where, to which target" record — distinct from `LoginAttempt`
# (which is per-attempt). Never auto-pruned.
#
# `source_surface` enum (`web` / `tui` / `mcp`) mirrors
# `BlockedLocation#source_surface` so an approve from a CLI in-TUI
# overlay vs an approve from the MCP tool is durable in the audit
# trail.
#
# `action` enum is the LD-13 vocabulary. The 01c sub-spec only
# writes `approve` and `block`; the other values are pre-declared so
# 01d / 01e / 01f need no further migration.
#
# `target_type` + `target_id` are a polymorphic pointer (NOT a
# `belongs_to :target, polymorphic: true` — the polymorphic
# association would create accidental dependent-destroy paths and we
# never want the audit row to follow the target into deletion). The
# target is the row the action was performed on: usually a
# `LoginAttempt` (approve / block / pending-resolve), sometimes a
# `BlockedLocation` (unblock / purge), or `User` (TOTP enroll /
# disable / backup-code regenerate).
#
# `metadata` is a free-form jsonb bag for sub-spec-specific extras
# (e.g., the resolved fingerprint short hash, the IP prefix, the
# attempt id when the target is a session, etc.). Keys are strings.
