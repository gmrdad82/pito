## Resume context (read this first on a cold start)

Established by exploring the repo + interviews with Catalin on 2026-05-29. Ground truth.

### What this plan is

Consolidation after Plan 3 (chat): remove dead/legacy surfaces, rework auth to a
cookie-backed session (no Session table), reset to one schema migration, audit columns,
freeze ViewComponent CSS, factory every model + self-validating spec, reorganize rake into
`pito:test:*` / `pito:tools:*`, add an ffprobe footage tool — **plus** a UI reboot (`/`
start screen → `/chat/:uuid`, real caret, async dispatch, Braille thinking indicator),
channel `/connect`/`/disconnect`, TAB/Shift+TAB, **video import/edit/publish (VideoPreview)**,
IGDB game search/`add`, and multi-conversation history (`/new`, `/resume`, sidebar, rename).

### Working agreements (from Catalin)

- **Two execution tiers:** `[low]` → any cheap model; `[high]` → Sonnet or Catalin.
  `[manual]` = operator (commits, smoke tests, decisions, investigations, OAuth). Smallest
  possible tasks — 500 is fine.
- **No `[skipci]`**, no co-author trailer. **Current branch**, no new branch, no tags.
- Specs **ON**. Throwaway plan docs (durable docs at merge).

### Codebase facts

- **Stack:** Rails 8.1, Postgres (citext, pg_trgm, pgcrypto, unaccent, **vector**),
  Turbo + Stimulus + importmap, view_component, tailwindcss-rails, SolidQueue/Cache/Cable,
  RSpec + FactoryBot + faker + shoulda-matchers + webmock + parallel_tests.
- **18 tables / 20 models.** Domain: Channel, Video, Game, Footage, Company, Genre + joins.
  Missing (add when needed): Calendar/CalendarEntry, Notification. **Playlist: dropped** — no model,
  not supported/modifiable; shown read-only on a video only if YouTube provides it.
- **Search:** pg_trgm + pgvector HNSW (Voyage). Meilisearch dropped; indexers linger.
- **Auth today:** rotp TOTP + omniauth-google + `Session` DB model + AppSetting singleton + TotpBackupCode.
- **Factories** only for conversation/turn/event. No `factories_spec`.
- **Footage already has ffprobe-shaped columns** — ffprobe is a *populate* job.
- **IGDB stack mostly IN TREE:** `app/services/game/igdb/{client,apicalypse,game_mapper,
  rate_limiter,sync_game,token_cache}.rb` + `game/igdb.rb`; `game/search_service.rb`;
  `pito/search/search_games.rb`; jobs `game_igdb_sync.rb`, `game_sync.rb`,
  `game_igdb_nightly_refresh.rb`. **Dropped (history only):** the search UI
  (`igdb_search_modal_controller.js`, `games/_search_results*.html.erb`,
  `shared/_igdb_search_modal.html.erb`). Rebuild as a sidebar.

### Recovered Game score formula (verbatim, from git history)

`pito/score_bar_component.rb#synthesized_score`: vote-weighted average of the three IGDB
triplets, drop zero-vote, `numerator.fdiv(denominator).round`, nil when no votes.

### Decisions (locked unless re-opened)

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Auth | Drop `Session` model + `sessions` table; **signed cookie, rolling 24h idle expiry, no remember-me**. Keep TOTP login + `pito:tools:auth`. Remove `pito:sessions:list`. |
| rack-attack | Remove (local app). |
| MCP / API | Remove `/mcp` + `/api` endpoints + trail if present. |
| Footage | `game` **required**; `filename` unique scoped to `game_id`; no `local_path`. ADD `needs_grading`, `orientation`. DROP `audio_track_count` (derive), `color_profile`, `codec`, `has_commentary_track`. KEEP `bit_depth`, `resolution`, `fps`, `duration_seconds`, `audio_track_names[]`, `aspect_ratio`. |
| `needs_grading` | `false` only for Rec.709/SDR; else `true`. Validate vs real footage later. |
| Game ratings | KEEP all three triplets. ADD stored `score` int (0–100) via the recovered formula. |
| Steam | **DROP `external_steam_app_id`.** |
| `igdb_checksum` | Investigation (P8): is it (or an IGDB timestamp) used to skip unchanged syncs? Keep+wire if it saves calls; DROP if unused. |
| `release_year` | Investigation (P8): check IGDB payload, then keep vs `release_date`+`release_precision`. |
| Schema | **One fresh single-file migration.** Adds `turns.started_at/completed_at`, `conversations.uuid`, `videos.etag`, and a `video_previews` table. |
| Dispatch | **Async.** POST → **persist echo then broadcast** → Braille → enqueue job → job **persists result then broadcasts** → "<word> for Ns" (backend elapsed). **Persist-before-broadcast** so refresh conserves the conversation. |
| Command context | Every chat POST carries the TAB channel (`@all`/`@handle`) + Shift+TAB period. The channel is used; the **period is dead data for now** — carried + displayed, but used only in future analytics. |
| Read-only mirrors | `Channel` and `Video` are **read-only mirrors of YouTube** — never edited directly. `Playlist` is **dropped** (no model); only shown read-only on a video if YouTube provides it. |
| `/import videos` | PULL. **Smart/incremental:** store `etag`/checksum + `last_synced_at`; walk the uploads playlist newest-first; `videos.list` only new/changed ids; **stop after a run of known-unchanged**. Per-channel jobs + progress Segments. (Period does NOT scope it.) |
| VideoPreview | The one writable surface. Stages edits to (per YouTube Studio): **title, description, tags, category + game title, made-for-kids, paid promotion, AI/altered-content disclosure, allow embedding, allow automatic chapters & key moments, allow automatic places (Featured places), allow automatic concepts, notify subscribers, Shorts remixing (video+audio / audio-only / none), thumbnail**. **Full edit UI** via `/edit video <id>`. **Publish pushes only the YouTube Data API-supported subset** (title/description/tags/category/made-for-kids/embeddable/AI-disclosure, + privacy/`publishAt` via lifecycle); the Studio-only toggles (paid promotion, automatic chapters/places/concepts, Shorts remixing, notify subscribers) are staged but may not be API-writable — **verify per field**. `Video` untouched until YouTube confirms. |
| `/update videos` | PUBLISH pending VideoPreviews → YouTube (videos.update + thumbnails.set); on each success **enqueue a single-video import** to refresh `Video`. Per-channel jobs + progress Segments. |
| Video lifecycle | `/publish`, `/schedule`, `/unlist`, `/delete` each open a **sidebar picker** of eligible videos → select → echo + async job → Braille → result Segment **with a link to the video**. publish/schedule/unlist push privacy/`publishAt` then re-import; `/schedule` adds a date step; `/delete` confirms, then deletes on YouTube + removes the local `Video`. |
| ScoreBar + TTB | Restore both; mark **kept-but-unused**. |
| `/_ui` | Removed. |
| Conversation | `/` = start screen. Conversation at `/chat/:uuid` (uuid col; PK stays bigint). `title` = name, default `"Unnamed N"`, rename supported. |
| Transition / echo | Enter → animate chatbox to bottom → **URL → `/chat/:uuid`** → POST → **echo only after that** → thinking → result. |
| Channels | One Google account (`YoutubeConnection`) → many `Channel`s, addable incrementally. `/connect` picker lists the account's channels (keyboard + mouse). `/disconnect` drops the channel + its videos; drop the `YoutubeConnection` too if it was the last channel. |
| Games search/add | Re-wire in-tree IGDB services; rebuild search UI as a **sidebar**; `/add game` adds an IGDB game to the **global library**. On add: enqueue `GameIgdbSync` **once**. Daily `GameIgdbNightlyRefresh` for **not-yet-released** games. |
| `/resume` "session" | A **Conversation**. |
| Analytics | Out of scope. Shift+TAB period UI built but **unwired**. Future `Pito::Stats` / `Pito::Analytics`. |
| Braille words | Two dictionaries — slash vs chat — by leading `/`. Past-tense "X for Ns" on completion (P25). |

---

## North star

`/` opens a centered chatbox over the logo. Enter → transition drops the chatbox to the
bottom, URL → `/chat/:uuid`, POST → echoed command Segment → Braille indicator cycles words,
resolves to "…for Ns" (backend elapsed) → result Segment (distinct accent), all async.
`/connect` adds YouTube channels (many per account); `/disconnect` removes one (+ videos, +
orphan connection). TAB cycles channels, Shift+TAB periods. `/import videos` pulls
smart/incrementally; you edit metadata into a `VideoPreview` and `/update videos` publishes
it to YouTube then re-imports. `/add game` searches IGDB in a sidebar and adds to the library
(async full sync); unreleased games refresh daily. `/new` starts a chat; `/resume` opens a
sidebar of named, time-grouped conversations. Underneath: dead code gone, one clean schema
migration, every model factoried + auto-validated, rake split, `pito:tools:probe`.

## Complexity hints

| Hint | When |
|---|---|
| `[manual]` | Operator: commits, smoke tests, decisions, investigations, OAuth. |
| `[low]` | Mechanical, decided. |
| `[high]` | Architectural: cookie-session, schema squash, async dispatch, `data-accent`, ffprobe parse, score calc, transition, thinking indicator, OAuth multi-channel, smart import, VideoPreview publish, sidebar grouping, IGDB search sidebar. |

## Open questions / needs clarification

1. **`release_year` + `igdb_checksum` (P8):** both decided by the P8 investigation.
2. **`needs_grading` rule:** validate against real ffprobe output (you'll test + feed back).
3. **VideoPreview API support (P32/P33):** the full Studio field set is now confirmed (screenshots). Verify per field which are writable via the YouTube **Data API v3** `videos.update` (title/description/tags/categoryId, `status.embeddable`, `status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids`, AI/synthetic-media disclosure, `publishAt`/privacy) vs **Studio-only** (paid promotion, automatic chapters/places/concepts, Shorts remixing, notify subscribers) — Studio-only fields can be staged in a preview but not auto-published.

_Resolved this round:_ video commands = `/import` + `/update` + lifecycle `/publish`/`/schedule`/`/unlist`/`/delete`; `Video` + `Channel` read-only mirrors, `Playlist` dropped; smart import (etag/checksum + incremental); VideoPreview field set matches Studio (screenshots); VideoPreview edit via `/edit video <id>`; `/add game` → global library; **period is dead data**; **cookie 24h idle, no hard max**; Active Storage on; transition approved (must feel live/cool); **video targeting = sidebar picker** (`/publish`/`/schedule`/`/unlist`/`/delete` pick eligible videos; `/schedule` adds a date step; result links to the video).

## Still to cover (not yet discussed)

- **Chat box autocomplete / autosuggestions** (deferred — discuss later).
- Further UI enhancements beyond those listed.
- `Pito::Stats` design (daily snapshot tables/jobs for channel + video totals).
- `Pito::Analytics` (wire TAB channel + Shift+TAB period into real queries).
- Real chat/slash domain handlers (list videos, channel overview…).
- Games detail screen (host for ScoreBar + TTB + probe snippet + `/add game` detail pane).
- A **videos list screen** (host for `/edit video` + lifecycle actions + a friendlier video target picker).

## Open follow-ups (explicitly later)

- `Pito::Stats` / `Pito::Analytics` plans; wire TAB/period.
- Games detail screen; videos list screen.
- `Calendar`/`CalendarEntry`, `Notification` models — add when needed. (Playlist dropped — not supported.)
- Remote footage ingest (script + HTTP endpoint) if/when on Hetzner.
- At merge: delete `plan-beta-reboot-*.md`; fold durable content into `architecture.md` / `design.md` / `installation.md` / `tools.md`.

## How to use this plan

1. Draft — expect revisions as "Still to cover" lands.
2. Next unchecked task in phase order. `[low]` → cheap model; `[high]` → Sonnet/Catalin; `[manual]` → operator.
3. Implement, verify (diff + affected spec/flow), check the box.
4. Commit at each phase's commit task — plain message, no `[skipci]`.
5. Split anything bigger than 5 minutes.
6. **P0 (Pre-flight) is exempt from the commit-gate rule** — it is verification-only and produces no code, so it has no `Commit:` task. Every other phase ends with one.
